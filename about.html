  <h3>What is Hoon?</h3>
  <p id="difftext">Hoon, (noun) a hoon (derived from hoonigan) is an Australian term describing a person who deliberately drives a vehicle in a reckless or dangerous manner, generally in order to provoke a reaction from onlookers.</p>

  <p id="difftext">Hoon activities (or hooning) can include speeding, burnouts, doughnuts, or screeching tires.</p>

  <p id="difftext">At Hoon Fabrication we take pride in making every car a hoon car, in short "we'll make it hoon!"

  <p id="difftext">Please hoon responsibly!</p>

  <h3>Who is hooning at Hoon Fabrication?</h3>
  <p id="difftext">Shade Tree Shaun is here to help you with your automotive needs. Getting the project car going is was he's been doing for years. He's been hooning every car he's had regardless of the cars ability to do so. Some of his fonest memories are perfecting his E-brake turns and putting his 1st car straight into a ditch on icy roads.</p>

  <p id="difftext">You can rest assured that a percentage of every dollar spent at Hoon Fabrication will go back into one of his project cars making each of them as hoonable as possible.
    <a class="image featured" id="about_text"><img src="images/shaun.jpg" alt="" /></a>

  <p id="difftext">Earning a degreee in electronics led him into a career of high end manurfacturing. He has built cameras that have traveled to the bottom of the ocean and to the surface of Mars. He has a high understanding of what it takes to make quality products. However he found that the good ol' shop enviroment was more fun.
