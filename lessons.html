                <p><strong>$150</strong></p>
                <p> An introductory paragliding lesson gets you off the ground and into the air on your very first day!</p>

                <p>Introductory lessons take place at the Point of the Mountain flight park during the first 4 hours of of the day while the air is the most consistently smooth and predictable. The entire cost of the lesson may be applied towards a P2 certification with Salt Lake Paragliding.</p>

                <p>The lesson begins with basic paragliding concepts, fitting you for paragliding equipment, and safety procedures including an instructor always on a radio with you. Next, you will learn how to inflate and launch your glider by running across flat ground with your wing flying above you. Once you internalize your inflation technique, you will practice running inflations down a small hill. You will feel your wing start to lift you up and bear some of your weight. This will make it easier for you to run and practice steering your wing so that it stays positioned directly over your head. By the end of your lesson, you will progress to taking short flights down the hill with about 50 ft of altitude.</p>

                <p>Becoming a safe and confident paraglider pilot is an exciting and fulfilling journey.</p>

                <p>A P2 paragliding rating allows paraglider pilots to fly at beginner sites by themselves. Our P2 certification program is taught at the Point of the Mountain in Utah, widely recognized as one of the best and most consistent flying sites in the world.</p>

                <p>The minimum requirements for P2 certification through the United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (USHPA) are 35 flights, 7 flying days, and 8 hours of ground school. Most pilots desire much more time and practice than these minimums to feel fully prepared and comfortable flying on their own.</p>

                <p>Our P2 certification program teaches everything necessary to become a proficient and safe pilot at your own pace.
